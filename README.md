# Wendy Works 
WendyWorks is designed with the Wellesley community in mind. The application provides a centralized place for people to seek and request various services: sewing, baking, driving, moving help, etc. Because Wellesley students have many different skills and come from different backgrounds, there are many things they do and donâ€™t know how to do! This site offers more financially-accessible alternatives for services and can become a source of side income for students. While posts requesting and offering services exist on apps like Sidechat, Facebook, and Instagram, adedicated site for these functionalities helps centralize the purpose of acquiring and giving help while also allowing students to make a little money on the side.
